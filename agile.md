# Agile Process Overview

The Agile methodology is a type of project management process, mainly used for software development, where demands and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams.

## Principles of Agile

The Agile methodology follows twelve key principles:

1. **Customer satisfaction** - Priority to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. **Welcome changing requirements** - Embrace changes in requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. **Deliver working software frequently** - Deliver working software frequently, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. **Collaboration** - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. **Supportive environment** - Build projects around motivated individuals, give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. **Face-to-face conversation** - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information is through face-to-face conversation.
7. **Working software** - Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. **Sustainable development** - Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. **Technical excellence** - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. **Simplicity** - The art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential.
11. **Self-organizing teams** - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. **Regular reflection** - The team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Agile Process Steps

The Agile process usually involves the following steps:

1. **Project Planning or Roadmap**: Establish an overall vision for the project, and create a roadmap.

2. **Product Backlog**: Create a list of tasks to be completed, known as the "product backlog".

3. **Sprint Planning**: Break down the project into smaller, manageable chunks called "sprints", and plan the first one.

4. **Sprint**: Execute on the tasks decided during the sprint planning.

5. **Daily Standup or Scrum**: Regular short meetings to update the team about progress.

6. **Sprint Review**: At the end of each sprint, review the work completed and adjust the product backlog if needed.

7. **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect on the past sprint and look for ways to improve the process going forward.

8. **Repeat**: The next sprint begins. Repeat steps 3-7 until the product backlog is empty.

## Key Roles in Agile

1. **Product Owner**: The person responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog, and ensuring the team is working on the most valuable features.

2. **Scrum Master**: The person responsible for ensuring the team follows Agile principles and practices, removes impediments, and helps the team stay productive.

3. **Team Members**: The individuals who carry out the tasks to develop the product.

Remember, Agile is about adaptability and quick responses to change. It's important to tailor these principles and steps to suit your project's specific needs.

## Tickets/Issues and Story Points

Agile development often involves tracking work in terms of tickets or issues. These tickets are tasks that are written and tracked through a management system like Jira, Trello, or GitHub. Each ticket represents a piece of work that needs to be done, such as a bug that needs fixing, a feature that needs creating, or an improvement that needs implementing.

### Writing Tickets/Issues

Effective tickets or issues should include:

1. **Title**: A clear, concise title that summarizes the task at hand.
2. **Description**: Detailed information about what the task involves. It should provide enough detail for anyone on the team to pick up the ticket and work on it.
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: A list of requirements that a ticket must meet in order for it to be considered 'done'.
4. **Labels/Tags**: Labels or tags can be used to categorize tickets, making it easier to sort and filter them.

### Story Points

In Agile development, work is often estimated using a measure called 'story points'. Story points are a unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work.

Story points can be determined using various factors such as:

1. **Complexity**: How complicated is the task?
2. **Effort**: How much work is required to complete the task?
3. **Uncertainty**: How much about this task is unknown?
4. **Risk**: What risks are involved with this task?

Teams usually establish a baseline story, assigning it a certain amount of points (often 1 or 2), and then estimate other stories relative to that. It's important to remember that story points are an estimate, and it's natural for teams to get better at estimating these as they work together longer.

### Sprint Planning and Story Pointing

During sprint planning, the team will assign story points to each item in the sprint backlog. The total number of story points will help determine how much work the team can commit to in the upcoming sprint. 

This process is often facilitated by a technique called 'planning poker', where team members make estimates by playing numbered cards face-down on the table, instead of speaking them aloud, to avoid cognitive bias. After everyone has played a card, the cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed.

### Burn-down Charts

A burn-down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. It is very useful in Agile methodologies for tracking the team's progress. The x-axis typically represents time, and the y-axis represents story points. As the team completes tasks, the line on the burn-down chart goes down, indicating the remaining work to be done.
