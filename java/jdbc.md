# JDBC, PreparedStatement, and ResultSet

- **JDBC**: Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an API in Java that defines how a client may access a database. It provides methods to query and update data in a database, and is oriented towards relational databases. The `UserDAO` class uses JDBC to interact with the database.

- **PreparedStatement**: `PreparedStatement` is a class in JDBC that represents a precompiled SQL statement that can be executed multiple times without recompilation.

- **ResultSet**: `ResultSet` is a class in JDBC that represents a table of data generated by executing a statement that queries the database. The `ResultSet` object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data. The `UserDAO` class uses `ResultSet` to read the data returned by SQL queries.

## Benefits of Using JDBC, PreparedStatement, and ResultSet

- **Efficiency and Security**: `PreparedStatement` helps to prevent SQL injection attacks because it automatically escapes the special characters. Furthermore, `PreparedStatement` objects can be reused with different input values to the query, making them potentially more efficient than using `Statement` objects.

- **Ease of Use**: `ResultSet` makes it easy to read data from a database. You can retrieve data by column name or column index, and you can read data in any type, such as `int`, `String`, etc.

- **Flexibility**: JDBC provides a lot of flexibility to connect to any relational database, to execute SQL commands and to handle the results returned by database queries.

## Practical Examples

### JDBC
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) allows you to connect your Java application with a database. Here is an example of how you might establish a connection using JDBC:

```java
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(dbURL, username, password);
```

In the above example, **dbURL** is the database URL, and **username** and **password** are the credentials you use to connect to the database.

### PreparedStatement
**PreparedStatement** in JDBC represents a precompiled SQL statement. This can be more efficient and safer than a regular SQL statement. Here's how you might use it:

```java
String sql = "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?, ?)";
PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
ps.setString(1, "myUsername");
ps.setString(2, "myPassword");
ps.executeUpdate();
```

In this example, **?** are placeholders that you fill in with the **setString** method. The **executeUpdate** method is used to run the SQL command.

### ResultSet
**ResultSet** represents a table of data from a database query. You can navigate through **ResultSet** and retrieve the values:

```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?";
PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
ps.setString(1, "myUsername");
ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
if (rs.next()) {
    String password = rs.getString("password");
    // Now you have the password for the user "myUsername"
}
```
In this example, the **executeQuery** method is used to run the SELECT command, and **rs.next** is used to navigate through the rows of the result. The **getString** method is used to retrieve the value of the 'password' column from the current row.
